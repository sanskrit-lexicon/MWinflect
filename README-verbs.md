In inputs/verbs, the main input for declensions is `lexnorm-all2.txt`.
`sh redo.sh` recreates `stem_model.txt`, which is the main input file
for declensions.


In inflect, `sh redo_verbs.sh` recreates 
`outputs/verbs/stem_model_tab.txt`, which is the file of declined
forms based primarily upon `stem_model.txt`.
