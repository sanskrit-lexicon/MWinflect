Scripts and programs to generate inflection tables and check the results.

The idea is to use 'inputs' directory to guide the process.
and to put the inflection tables into parallel locations of the
'outputs' directory. The decline_file program does this:

python decline_file.py ../inputs/nominals/<file> ../outputs/nominals/<file>

The input file has three tab-delimited fields:
1) <model>   the model name1
2) key2  the word to inflect, with '-' to delimit padas
3) refs MW source records, specified as a colon-delimited sequence of 'L,key1' pairs

The output file has four tab-delimited fields:
1) <model>  copied from input file
2) key2     copied from input file
3) refs     copied from input file
4) inflect  inflection table

The inflection table format:

For nominals, the inflection table format in the output of decline_file is
a csv string with ':' delimiter, with 24 fields.
   for cases 1s,1d,1p,...8s,8d,8p  (8 = vocative).
   Each of the 24 fields allows the possibility of multiple values, separated
   by '/' character.
For indeclineables,  the stem (without '-')

The input file is constructed from two pieces:
1) ../inputs/nominals/stem_model.txt  [See readme therein for discussion]
2) stem_model_todo.txt   a file constructed somehow with likely cases where
   the declension algorithm either is not written or else is believed to
   be incorrect.  This todo file will change over time.
   As of 11-17-2019, it contains 2300+ stem-model cases derived by 
   comparison of the inflection table with the previous 'lgtab1' inflections.

The redo_nominals.sh script does two things:
a) constructs a temporary input file temp_stem_model.txt by removing
   stem_model_todo.txt records from ../inputs/nominals/stem_model.txt.
   python3 stem_model_diff.py ../inputs/nominals/stem_model.txt stem_model_todo.txt temp_stem_model.txt
b) Constructs inflection table ../outputs/nominals/stem_model_tab.txt from 
   temp_stem_model.txt.
   python3 decline_file.py  temp_stem_model.txt ../outputs/nominals/stem_model_tab.txt

# temp_analysis
contains various analyses -- poorly documented.
